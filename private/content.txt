  This is a personalized wedding day clutch. It has a heavy damask satin woven fabric shell with a delicate pearl and sequin motif detail on the outside. The lining is a satin dot weave. The wrist bracelet is a silver ball barring chain with a toggle closure. The inside photograph is a personalized picture sent to us by our customers.
  This item was inspired by my sister-in-law. She requested that I make her a few fun Christmas bags for her daughter and daughter-in-law. We personalized each bag with memorable pictures. Having a little memory of a moment or someone special was a perfect gift that can also be used for a beautiful bride. The personalized wedding clutch was created. This clutch is perfect for holding phones, IDs, lipstick, or any other delicate items a bride may need.
